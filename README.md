##Overview of the Pewlett Hackard Analysis##
---
<sub>In this assignment our purpose was to create and clean an employee database for the Pewlett Hackard company. Starting with a quick ERD to visualize the code in a psudeo code type of form to game plan off of. Continuing into PGadmin we took that gameplan and initialized a set of tables. Then using our data we were able to insert that data into said tables. Bobby was then asked for a more clean analysis given the large dataset. We were able to break down the soon to be retiree's by setting parameters of birth date, hire dates and of course current employee. This gives the managment the numbers on employee retention, employee turnover, and a mentorship program,</sub>

- 2. However when we removed the 9th grade from our data frame, we found a big leap. The %Overall Passing fell by almost 25%.

- 3. Before adjusting Thomas Highschools data, they were in the top 5 school and fell to the 3rd to last after the adjustment.

- 4. As a result all the other schools averages and ranks were raised due to being compared to true data.

**Summary**
---
Originally our top five were Cabrera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, and Pena. After our final analysis this completely changes and is now Cabrera, Griffin, Wilson, Pena, and Wright. Our school size averages were affected heavily. The %Overall Passing of medium schools fell from 91% to 85%. And charter schools %Overall Passing fell from 90% to 87%. So this one schools misinformation affected our overall metrics by huge margins.
