## Overview of the Pewlett Hackard Analysis ##
---
<sub>In this assignment our purpose was to create and clean an employee database for the Pewlett Hackard company. Starting with a quick ERD to visualize the code in a psudeo code type of form to game plan off of. Continuing into PGadmin we took that gameplan and initialized a set of tables. Then using our data we were able to insert that data into said tables. Bobby was then asked for a more clean analysis given the large dataset. We were able to break down the soon to be retiree's by setting parameters of birth date, hire dates and of course current employee. This gives the managment the numbers on employee retention, employee turnover, and a mentorship program,</sub>

## Results ##

- 1. First step in cleaning up the retiree's table was finding out what their title was so that department hiring can plan for replacements and where the retiree's might mentor.

- 2.Next, we needed to clean that table due to duplicates of employees who have switched positions over the years.

- 3. Next, we cleaned the data even more into a title specific list so management can see at a glance what departments will be hit the hardest.

- 4.Lastly, the company wants to start a mentorship program. So we made a table of employees born in 1965 and ordered them by employee number.

## Summary ##
---
Originally our top five were Cabrera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, and Pena. After our final analysis this completely changes and is now Cabrera, Griffin, Wilson, Pena, and Wright. Our school size averages were affected heavily. The %Overall Passing of medium schools fell from 91% to 85%. And charter schools %Overall Passing fell from 90% to 87%. So this one schools misinformation affected our overall metrics by huge margins.
